		<b>3 Idiots</b> is a <i>Hindi</i> film that follows three engineering students—the free-spirited Rancho, the aspiring photographer Farhan, and the family-burdened Raju—as they navigate the pressures of a rigid education system that emphasizes rote memorization over passion. Through flashbacks, their college days are depicted with humor and emotion, focusing on Rancho's influence in challenging academic norms and encouraging his friends to pursue their true dreams. The film critiques the educational system for its focus on grades and societal expectations, ultimately delivering a powerful message about the importance of following one's passion and chasing excellence rather than just success
